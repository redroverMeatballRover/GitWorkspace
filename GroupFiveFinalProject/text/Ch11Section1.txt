Section 11.1: Recursive Thinking

Recursion, a programming technique in which a method calls itself in order to fulfill its purpose.
A key to being able to program recursively is to learn to think recursively. One must be careful
with recursion. Like loops, infinite recursion will occur if there is nothing to stop it. Any 
recursive definition must have a non-recursive part, called the base case, which permits the 
recursion to eventually end. Recursion is useful for mathmatical methods.
