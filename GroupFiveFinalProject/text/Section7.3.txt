7.3 Arrays of Objects

Arrays can also store references to objects as elements. Fairly complex information management structures 
can be created using only arrays and other objects. For example, an array could contain objects, and each 
of those objects could consist of several variables and the methods that use them. Those variables could
themselves be arrays, and so on.
