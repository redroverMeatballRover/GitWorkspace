Section 6.3: Layout Managers

Every container is managed by an object called a layout manager that determines how the components in the container
are arranged visually. The layout manager is consulted  when needed, such as when the container is
 resized or when a component is added to the container.

setLayout method = we use this method to choose which layout to use.
Flow Layout = Organizes components from left to right, starting new rows as necessary.

Tabbed Pane = a container that allows the user to select (by clicking on a tab) which of several panes is 
currently visible. A tabbed pane is defined by the JTabbedPane class.

Flow Layout = Easiest layout manager to use. As we’ve mentioned, the JPanel class uses flow layout by default. 
Flow layout puts as many components as possible on a row,  at their preferred size. When a component 
cannot fit on a row, it is put on the next row.

Border Layout = Organizes components into five areas (North, South, East, West, and Center).
Grid Layout = Organizes components into a grid of rows and columns.

Grid Layout presents a container’s components in a rectangular grid of rows and columns. 
One component is placed in each grid cell, and all cells are the same size.

As buttons are added to the container, they fill the grid (by default) from left to right and top to bottom. 
There is no way to explicitly assign a component to a particular location in the grid other than the 
order in which they are added to the container.

Box Layout = Organizes components into a single row or column.
