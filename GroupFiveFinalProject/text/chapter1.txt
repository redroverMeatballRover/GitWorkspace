Chapter 1: Introduction

-Java is an object-oriented programming language. Objects are the fundamental elements that make up a program.
-The Java language is accompanied by a library of extra software that we can use when developing programs called the Java standard class library.
-Comments are used to help a human understand a program. Any writtencomments or documents, including a user’s guide and technical
 references, are called documentation.(// comment or /* comment */)

-The body of a program is called the class definition and runs from the first opening brace ({) to the final closing brace (}).
-A method is a group of programming statements that is given a name. All Java applications have a main method, which is where processing begins.
-The various words used when writing programs are called identifiers. These fall into three categories:
	* Words that we make up when writing a program.
	* Words that another programmer chose (String, System, out, println, and main).
	* Words that are reserved for special purposes in the language (class, public, static, and void).

-Java is case sensitive. The uppercase and lowercase versions of a letter are distinct.
-All Java programs use white space to separate the words and symbols used in a program. 
White space consists of blanks, tabs, and newline characters.
-Programming languages can be categorized into the following four groups. 

These groups basically reflect the historical development of computer languages.
	* machine language
	* assembly language
	* high-level languages
	* fourth-generation languages

-All programs must be translated to a particular CPU’s machine language in order to be executed.
-High-level languages allow a programmer to ignore the underlying details of machine language.
-Initially, you use an editor as you type a program into a computer and store it in a file.
-A compiler is a program that translates code in one language to equivalent code in another language.
The original code is called source code, and the language into which it is translated is called the target language.
-An interpreter is similar to a compiler but has an important difference. An interpreter interweaves the translation and execution activities.
-A software development environment is the set of tools used to create, test, and modify a program.
-Some environments are referred to as integrated development environments (IDEs) because they integrate various tools into one software program.
-Graphical user interface (GUI) is a user interface with windows, menus, buttons, etc.
-Each programming language has its own unique syntax. The syntax rules of a language dictate exactly how the vocabulary elements of the 
language can be combined to form statements.
-The semantics of a statement in a programming language define what will happen when that statement is executed.
-You will encounter three kinds of errors as you develop programs:
	* compile-time error
	* run-time error
	* logical error
