Section 1: Exception Handling

Coding problems that arise in a Java program may generate exceptions or errors. 

Exception- an object that defines an unusual or invalid proccessing. Exceptions are  
predefined and can be caught and handled. An error is similar to an exception, 
except that the situation is unrecoverable and it shouldn't be caught. Java, trying 
to be nice, predefined common exceptions and errors that could happen while running 
a program. If this isn't good enough for you, you can make your own exceptions. 

Some examples of situations that will produce exceptions:
 -attempting to divide by zero
  - an array index that is out of bounds a specified file that could not be found
  - a requested I/O operation that could not be completed normally
  - attempting to follow a null reference
  - attempting to execute an operation that violates some kind of security measure.
    The name of the exception says a lot about the sitution in which the exception occurs. 

Some exceptions are just a stupid programer error, while others are  out of the programmer's hands. 
Some exceptions are come from a wrong situation, while others occur in unusual conditions.
