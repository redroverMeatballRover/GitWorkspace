7.4 Command-Line Arguments

The Java run-time environment invokes the main method when an application is submitted to 
the interpreter. The String[] parameter, which we typically call args, represents command-line arguments 
that are provided when the interpreter is invoked. Any extra information on the command line when the
interpreter is invoked is stored in the args array for use by the program. This technique is
another way to provide input to a program.
