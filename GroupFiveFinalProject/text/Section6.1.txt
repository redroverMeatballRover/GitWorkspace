Section 6.1: GUI Elements

Many programs provide a graphical user interface (GUI) through which a user interacts with the program. As the name implies, 
a GUI makes use of graphical screen components such as windows, buttons, check boxes, menus, and text fields. GUIs often 
provide a more natural and rich experience for the user comparedd to a simple text-based, command line environment. 
This chapter explores the various issues related to developing a GUI in Java. 
This study guide will cover and isolate the main points in this section. 

GUI = Graphical User Interface
The basis of all GUIs : Components = object that defines a screen element used to display information / allow a user to interact with a program.
		  Listeners       = object that "waits" for an event to occur and responds in some way when it does. 
		  Events 	       = object that represents some occurance in which we may be interested. 
A big part of designing a GUI-based program is establishing the relationships among the listener, the event it listens for, and the 
component that will generate the event.
containers = special type of component used to hold and organize other components.

TO CREATE A GUI PROGRAM:
¦ instantiate and set up the necessary components,
¦ implement listener classes that define what happens when particular events occur
¦ establish the relationship between the listeners and the components that generate the events of interest.

Frame = container that is used to display GUI-based Java applications, it is defined by the JFrame class.
Panel =  container that needs to be added to another container for it to be displayed. Primary Role: help organize the other 
components in a GUI. A panel is defined by the JPanel class.

HeavyWeight container =  one that is managed by the underlying operating system on which the program is run
		     - ex: a frame
LightWeight container = managed by the Java program itself
		    - ex: a panel
Buttons & Action Events

Label =  created from the JLabel class. It is a component that displays a line of text in a GUI. A label can also be used to display an image.
Listener Classes = written by implementing an interface.
