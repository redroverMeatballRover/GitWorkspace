Chapter 3: Using Classes & Objects

-The act of creating an object using the new operator is called instantiation. An object is said to be an instance of a particular class.
-After the new operator creates the object, a constructor is invoked to help set it up initially.
-Multiple reference variables can refer to the same object. When two objects refer to the same variable they are aliases of each other.
-Methods are often executed on a particular object, and that object’s state usually affects the results.
-A class library is a set of classes that supports the development of programs.
-The class library is made up of several clusters of related classes, which are sometimes called Java APIs, or application programming interfaces.
-The Java standard class library is organized into packages.
-To use classes from any other package, however, we must either fully qualify the reference or use an import declaration.
-All classes of the java.lang package are automatically imported for every program.
-The Random class, which is part of the java.util package, represents a pseudorandom number generator.
-A pseudorandom number generator performs a complex calculation to create the illusion of randomness.
-The Math class provides a large number of basic mathematical functions that are often helpful in making calculations.

-All the methods in the Math class are static methods (also called class methods), which means they can be invoked through the name of the class in which 
they are defined, without having to instantiate an object of the class first.

-The NumberFormat class and the DecimalFormat class are used to format information so that it looks appropriate when printed or displayed.
-In addition to print and println, the System class has another output method called printf, which allows the user to print a formatted 
string containing data values.

-The printf method was added to Java to support the migration of legacy systems.

-Java provides the ability to define an enumerated type, which can then be used as the type of a variable when it is declared. An enumerated type 
establishes all possible values of a variable of that type by listing, or enumerating, them.

-Enumerated types are type-safe, ensuring that invalid values will not be used.
-A wrapper class allows a primitive value to be managed as an object.
-Autoboxing is the automatic conversion between a primitive value and a corresponding wrapper object.
