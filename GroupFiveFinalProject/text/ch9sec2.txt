Section 2 - Polymorphism by Inheritance
 
When a reference variable is declared, it can be used to refer to any object of the class name it was declared
with.it can also refer to any class related to its declared type by inheritance.
 
Imagine if Dog had a child called Domestic.So if a new Domestic object was made called pup, husky could be used
to refer to pup. Remeber the is-a relationship.This kind of relationship can work since a husky is a Dog and a pup
is also a Dog. The reverse, assigning Dog to husky can also be done but requires an explicit cast. It's also
rarely useful since the is-a relationship can break down in some cases. A husky does have the same functionality
of a Dog but the reverse is not always so.
 
This type of polymorphism is also good down the hierarchy. if Dog was derived was a class called Animal, then
Animal could make a new reference that points to a Domestic object. Also going all the way to the source with
this idea, an Object reference can refer to any Object since all classes originate from the Object class.
 
Remeber when a polymorphed object has it's methods called, it will use the mthods it has in that period of time.
Use of a UML Diagram may help one to see where an object and it's metods should be called.
