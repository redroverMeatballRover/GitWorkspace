Section 7.5: Variable-Length Parameter Lists

Suppose we wanted to design a method that processed a different amount of data from 
one invocation to the next. For example, let’s design a method called average that accepts 
a few integer values and returns their average. In one invocation of the method we might pass
in three integers to average: mean1 = average(42, 69, 37); In another invocation of the same method we might pass in seven
integers to average: mean2 = average(35, 43, 93, 23, 40, 21, 75); To accomplish this we could define 
overloaded versions of the average method (as we did in the exercises at the end of Chapter 5). But that solution
doesn’t scale to an arbitrary set of input values. It would require that we know the maximum number 
of parameters there might be and create a separate version of the method for each possibility.
