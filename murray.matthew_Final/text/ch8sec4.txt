Section 4 - Visibility
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to design classes for visibility. If one class needs to keep some aspects to itself, they should be
set private. If they need to affected by the whole program, set it to public. If an aspect is only important
between child and parent, make it protected.Feel mfree to mix these in a class as needed.
 
Not much new to be said here, really.
