Section 6.4: Mouse and Key Events

There are events that are fired when the user interacts with the computer’s mouse and keyboard. We can design a 
program to capture and respond to these as well.

Mouse Events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse Events = Events including mouse pressed, mouse released, mouse clicked, mouse entered, and mouse exited.
Mouse Motion Events = mouse moved and mouse dragged

Key Events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Event =  Generated when a keyboard key is pressed. Key events allow a program to respond immediately
 to the user while he or she is typing or pressing other
keyboard keys such as the arrow keys.

Extending Adapter Classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Adapter Class = An alternative technique for creating a listener class via inheritance. Each listener interface 
that contains more than one method has a corresponding adapter class that already contains empty 
definitions for all of the methods in the interface.
