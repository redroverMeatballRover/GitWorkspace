Chapter 4: Conditionals & Loops


-Conditionals and loops allow us to control the flow of execution through a method.
-An if statement allows a program to choose whether to execute a particular statement.
-A conditional statement is sometimes called a selection statement because it allows us to choose which statement will be executed next.
-A loop allows a program to execute a statement multiple times.
-Java has three types of loop statements: the while statement, the do statement, and the for statement.
-Java also has several relational operators that let us decide the relative ordering between two values.
-The ! operator is used to perform the logical NOT operation, which is also called the logical complement.
-A logical operation can be described by a truth table that lists all possible combinations of values for the variables involved in an expression.
-The && operator performs a logical AND operation. The result of an && operation is true if both operands are true, but false otherwise.
-Compare that to the result of the logical OR operator (||), which is true if one or the other or both operands are true, but false otherwise.
-Logical operators can be used to construct sophisticated conditions.
-An if statement consists of the reserved word if followed by a boolean expression, followed by a statement.
-Proper indentation is important for human readability; it shows the relationship between one statement and another.

-Sometimes we want to do one thing if a condition is true and another thing if that condition is false. We can add an else clause to an if statement, 
making it an ifelse statement, to handle this kind of situation.

-In Java, we can replace any single statement with a block statement. A block statement is a collection of statements enclosed in braces.
-The Java conditional operator is similar to an if-else statement in some ways. It is a ternary operator because it requires three operands.

-The statement executed as the result of an if statement could be another if statement. This situation is called a nested if. It allows us to make 
another decision after determining the results of a previous decision.

-In a nested if statement, an else clause is matched to the closest unmatched if.
-Two floating point values are equal, according to the == operator, only if all the binary digits of their underlying representations match.
-The relative order of characters in Java is defined by the Unicode character set.
-The compareTo method can be used to determine the relative order of strings.

-Another conditional statement in Java is called the switch statement, which causes the executing program to follow one of several paths based on a single
value. A break statement is used to break out of a switch statement. 

-A while statement executes the same statement repeatedly until its condition becomes false.
-We generally want our programs to be robust, which means that they handle potential problems as elegantly as possible.

-It is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the condition of a loop will eventually become false. If it doesn’t, the loop body will execute 
forever, or at least until the program is interrupted. This situation, referred to as an infinite loop, is a common mistake.
