Visual Effects and Shortcuts

Borders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java provides the ability to put a border around any Swing component. A border is not a component itself but rather defines how the edge of 
any component should be drawn and has an important effect on the design of a GUI.

Types of Borders:

Empty Border 	= Puts buffering space around the edge of a component, but otherwise has no visual effect.
Line Border 	= Creates the effect of an etched groove around a component.
Etched Border 	= A simple line surrounding the component.
Bevel Border 	= Creates the effect of a component raised above the surface or sunken below it.
Titled Border 	= Includes a text title on or around the border.
Matte Border 	= Allows the size of each edge to be specified. Uses either a soild color or an image.
Compound Border 	= A combination of two borders.
