Section 10.2: Uncaught Exceptions

If an exception goes unhandeled, the program will terminate when it hits the exception and a 
message in red will be produced. The first line will tell you what happened,  including the exception 
that occured and why it occured. The rest of the message is called a stack trace. It states where the 
exception occured. Depending on where the exception originated, the stack trace can be one or more
lines long. The first trace line indicates the method, file, and line number where the exception occurred. 
The other trace lines, if present, indicate the methods that were called to get to the method that produced the exception.
