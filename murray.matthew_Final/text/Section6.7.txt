Section 6.7: GUI Design & Review Questions

Four Rules of GUI Design

¦ Know the user.
¦ Prevent user errors.
¦ Optimize user abilities.
¦ Be consistent.

Summary of Key Concepts

¦ A GUI is made up of components, events that represent user actions, and listeners that respond to those events.
¦ A frame is displayed as a separate window, but a panel can only be displayed as part of another container.
¦ Listeners are often defined as inner classes because of the intimate relationship between the listener and the GUI components.
¦ Radio buttons operate as a group, providing a set of mutually exclusive options.
¦ A slider lets the user specify a numeric value within a bounded rang
¦ A combo box provides a drop down menu of options.
¦ A timer generates action events at regular intervals and can be used to control an animation.
¦ Every container is managed by a layout manager, which determines how components are visually presented.
¦ When changes occur, the components in a container reorganize themselves according to the layout manager’s policy.
¦ The layout manager for each container can be explicitly set.
¦ A GUI’s appearance is a function of the containment hierarchy and the layout managers of each container.
¦ Moving the mouse and clicking the mouse button generate events to which a program can respond.
¦ A listener may have to provide empty method definitions for unheeded events to satisfy the interface.
¦ Rubberbanding is the graphical effect caused when a shape seems to expand as the mouse is dragged.
¦ Key events allow a program to respond immediately to the user pressing keyboard keys.
¦ A listener class can be created by deriving it from an event adapter class.
¦ A file chooser allows the user to browse a disk and select a file to be processed.
¦ A color chooser allows the user to select a color from a palette or using RGB values.
¦ Borders can be applied to components to group objects and focus attention.
