Section 6.2: Components

In addition to push buttons, there are a variety of other interactive components that can be used in a GUI.
Text Field = allows the user to enter typed input from the keyboard.
Check Box = a button that can be toggled on or off using the mouse, indicating that a particular boolean condition is set or unset

itemStateChanged method = a listener that determines what the revised style should be now that one of the check boxes has changed state

radio button = is used with other radio buttons to provide a set of mutually exclusive options.
When a radio button from the group is pushed, the other button in the group that is currently on is automatically toggled off.

Slider = a GUI component that allows the user to specify a numeric value within a bounded range.
JSlider class = has several methods that allow the programmer to tailor the look of a slider. A slider produces a change event, indicating 
that the position of the slider and the value it 
represents has changed.

combo box = allows the user to select one of several options from a “drop down” menu.

Timer = created from the Timer class of the javax.swing package,  it does not have a visual representation 
that appears on the screen. it helps us manage an activity over time.

A timer object generates an action event at regular intervals. To perform an animation, we can set up a timer to 
generate an action event periodically, and then update the 
animation graphics in the action listener.
