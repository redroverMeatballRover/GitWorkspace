		 * COMMENT ON QUIZ:
		 * 
		 * Although this quiz was no doubt a good use of using exceptions, the time it takes to 
		 * get to the point where you can actually use exceptions and test for things takes way too long. 
		 * It did take me about an hour and 20 min just to get my randomWords working, but once i got to
		 * creating sentences and all the troubleshooting that would require, getting any score above a
		 * 5 is completely lost. Although i am capable of printing things to output files, using try-catches,
		 * using the finally clause, making custom exceptions, and exception handling in general, 
		 * this quiz forces me to work through a word-building, sentence building system that 
		 * i have neither encountered before, nor have had any experience from the book from, or am able to get
		 * any help on from other sources since this is indeed a quiz. 
		 * 
		 * While i am sure that the quiz does test the ability to test ability in exception handling, i feel that the word building and sentence building part of the quiz was extraneous and 
		 * a mostly inappropriate design given the amount of time for the quiz. 
		 * 
		 *  thanks, and sorry for the complaints.
